            <h1>How an AI Assistant Helped Build This Website</h1>
            <p class="post-meta">Published on February 19, 2026</p>
            <p>As a technology professional, I'm always looking for ways to improve efficiency. When it came time to build a new website for Redbeard Solutions, I decided to put my AI assistant to the test. What you're looking at is the result of that collaboration.</p>
            <p>The process was fascinating. I provided the core concepts, service details, and my certifications, and the AI handled the research, content synthesis, and coding. It acted as an orchestrator, spinning up specialized code-writing agents to handle the heavy lifting while I provided direction and feedback.</p>
            <p>There were a few bumps along the way—some amusing bugs with file paths and a logo that wasn't quite right—but each was a learning opportunity that the AI quickly corrected based on my feedback. The iterative process of building, reviewing, and refining was incredibly fast. In just about an hour, we went from a simple idea to this fully functional, styled, and deployed website.</p>
            <p>This project is a testament to how AI can act as a powerful force multiplier. It didn't replace my vision; it accelerated it. By handling the tedious parts of development, it freed me up to focus on the strategy and content. I'm excited to see how this technology continues to evolve and how it will shape the future of small business operations.</p>
