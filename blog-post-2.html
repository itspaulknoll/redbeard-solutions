            <h1>A Week of AI-Powered Prototyping: Four Projects, One Goal</h1>
            <p class="post-meta">Published on February 19, 2026</p>
            <p>The goal was to move beyond simple questions and answers and truly integrate an AI assistant as a technical partner. Over the last week, we tackled four distinct projects to test the limits of this collaboration. This post is a summary of that experiment in rapid, AI-assisted development.</p>

            <h2>Project 1: The Foundation - A New Operational Model</h2>
            <p>Before diving into specific tasks, we first established a new operational model. I configured the AI assistant to act as an "orchestrator." For any complex task, its directive is to spawn a specialized, isolated sub-agent to handle the work. This keeps the primary context clean and allows for more efficient, parallel processing. This foundational step was crucial for managing the projects that followed.</p>

            <h2>Project 2: The Smart Home - A Home Assistant POC</h2>
            <p>The first practical test was a proof-of-concept integration with a Home Assistant instance. Using a long-lived access token, the assistant successfully made API calls to the local server. We confirmed its capability by having it send a test notification and, more impressively, directly control the volume on a network-connected Denon AVR. This test proved its ability to interact with and control real-world smart devices.</p>

            <h2>Project 3: The Pivot - The Webcam Viewer</h2>
            <p>The next project was to build a simple webcam viewer. The initial plan was to use live JavaScript streams, but we quickly ran into technical hurdles. Instead of getting bogged down, we pivoted. The AI developed a more pragmatic solution: a webpage that takes a snapshot from each camera every five seconds and displays it in an auto-refreshing grid. This project was a key test of the AI's ability to adapt to real-world constraints and find a working solution.</p>

            <h2>Project 4: The Public Face - This Website</h2>
            <p>The final and most comprehensive project was building the very website you are on now. The AI handled the entire development lifecycle: research, content synthesis, HTML/CSS/JS coding, and iterative revisions based on my direct feedback. From a simple prompt, it created the structure, styled the pages, added a contact form, and even wrote the first blog post about its own creation.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This series of projects demonstrates the true potential of an AI assistant as a force multiplier. It's a partner that can manage its own workflow, integrate with APIs, adapt to challenges, and execute complex, multi-step tasks from start to finish. The era of the AI-powered development cycle is here.</p>
