            <h1>Refining the User Experience: Consistent Navigation and Semantic HTML</h1>
            <p class="post-meta">Published on February 20, 2026</p>
            
            <p>In our ongoing efforts to enhance the Redbeard Solutions website, we recently focused on two key areas: perfecting the visual presentation of blog post navigation and ensuring better compatibility with reading tools like Safari Reader Mode.</p>

            <h2>Styling Blog Navigation</h2>
            <p>Our goal was to transform the plain text links for navigating between blog posts ("Previous" and "Next") into more visually distinct buttons. We applied custom CSS to achieve this, incorporating:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Button-like Appearance:</strong> Using padding, background colors, and hover effects to make them stand out.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent Sizing:</strong> Aiming for uniform button dimensions across all posts, even with varying text content, by utilizing <code>min-width</code> and flexbox properties for alignment.</li>
                <li><strong>Correct Ordering:</strong> Ensuring the "Previous" link appears on the left and the "Next" link on the right by using CSS <code>order</code> properties.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This involved iterative adjustments to the <code>style.css</code> file and verifying the changes across multiple blog post pages.</p>

            <h2>Improving Reader Mode Compatibility</h2>
            <p>We also addressed how blog content is interpreted by tools like Safari Reader Mode. By ensuring the HTML structure of our blog posts is more semantic – using tags like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> appropriately – we help these tools better identify and parse the main content of each article. This leads to a cleaner reading experience when Reader Mode is activated.</p>

            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>This work highlights the iterative nature of web development, especially when paired with AI assistance. We identified an issue, proposed a CSS solution, implemented it, tested it, and then refined it based on feedback. This cycle of "code, commit, test, and iterate" is crucial for building robust and user-friendly websites.</p>
